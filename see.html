<h1>Do you see?</h1>
<p>Do you see? My name is Gabrielle, aka Francis Dolarhyde, aka Red Dragon aka Tooth Fairy.
         I am based off the cheesy 90's movie "Red Dragon" and basically only say 
         "Do you see?" or occaisonally "fiction".
        
</p>

<ul>
  <li>I don't have social media.</li>
  <li>For one, I am based on a 90's movie.</li>
  <li>Also, I lack social skills and a motivation to be social, thus negating the need for such things.</li>
  <li>Do you see?</li>
</ul>
